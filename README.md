## Overview

You play as a shopkeeper in the city of Irpin during the Ky√Øv offensive (February 24, 2022 - April 6, 2022). The game explores daily life as it gradually transforms under the shadow of war, challenging players with moral choices and the ultimate decision: should you stay or should you go?

- Personal choices with consequences, but no control over external events
- The banality of war as it intrudes into everyday life

- Leaving the war to become a refugee, or staying and fighting or helping others?

## Narrative Structure
